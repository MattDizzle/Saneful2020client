    <p>
      There are 3 metrics that you must maintain: Health, Sanity, Money - all three deplete with time.
    </p>
    <p>
      If health or sanity drop below 0 you will perishâ€¦
    </p>
    <p>
      There are multiple ways to increase and decrease your health, sanity and money and take a few lives to find a good survival strategy... but you are probably smarter than you look!
    </p>
    <p>
       Beware, difficulty increases with each passing day.
